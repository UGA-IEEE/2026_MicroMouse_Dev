# 2026 MicroMouse Development

&emsp;This repository is intended to provide a Research & Development (R&D) framework for understanding how potential aspects of the UGA IEEE MicroMouse are supposed to function at the Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC26) in San Antonio, TX. This enables smooth integration with the final hardware design.

&emsp;Since this repository is only for testing various components and aspects of the bot, the specific software within this repo will not be used in the final design. All final hardware and software implementations are proprietary to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Student Branch Chapter at The University of Georgia.
